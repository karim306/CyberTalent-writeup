1- we can see that our text was encoded by base64 

2- So  R[corrupted]BR3tCNDUzXzYxWDdZXzRSfQ==  --> as youcan see we are missing some letters after 'R' 

 but easily we can now the number of those missing you can see if you count the letters without the corrupted section 

  --> RBR3tCNDUzXzYxWDdZXzRSfQ==  --> they're 26 and with two '==' that means that there are missing two letters 

   just to be 28 letters so we are missing two letters after 'R' 

      *****Note that in base64 the ltters should be multible of four so when we have our encoded text isn't multiple of four 
       we put at the end ot it any number 0f '=' to be multiblr pf four *********

  3- Here is a python scriot to brute force the two letters

     `````````````````````
     import base64 
encodedStr = 'BR3tCNDUzXzYxWDdZXzRSfQ==' 
Map = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/=' ;

for i in range (64) : 
      for j in range (64) :
	       r= 'R' + Map[i] + Map[j] + encodedStr
	       decoded = base64.b64decode(r) 
	       if b'FLAG' in decoded :
        	 print (decoded)
    `````````````````````

  4- After you run the script you can noe see the flag --> FLAG{B453_61X7Y_4R}
